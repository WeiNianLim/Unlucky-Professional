            The Office is an American television sitcom that aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, lasting nine seasons.[1]
            It is an adaptation of the original BBC series of the same name and was adapted for American television by Greg Daniels,
            a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live, King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was co-produced by Daniels's Deedle-Dee
            Productions, and Reveille Productions (later Shine America), in association with Universal Television. The original executive
            producers were Greg Daniels, Howard Klein, Ben Silverman, Ricky Gervais, and Stephen Merchant, with numerous others being
            promoted in later seasons. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch
            of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. To simulate the look of an actual documentary, it was filmed in a single-camera
            setup, without a studio audience or a laugh track. The series debuted on NBC as a midseason replacement and aired 201 episodes
            over the course of its run. The Office initially featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and
            B. J. Novak as the main cast; the series experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run. The Office was
            met with mixed reviews during its first season, but the following four seasons received widespread acclaim from television
            critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody
            Award in 2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards,
            including one for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. Later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, with many seeing
            Carell's departure as a contributing factor. However, earlier writers oversaw the final season and ended the series' run
            with a positive reception. The series finale was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers, preceded by an hour-long series
            retrospective. Since its debut, the series has frequently been listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all time.
